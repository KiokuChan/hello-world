# hello-world
This is my first git repository. I am seeing how long this takes so I can plan time to show younger students I'll be instructing.
I am a graduate student. This summer I'll be teaching a game programming course for advanced high school and middle school students.
I have been a TA before, but that was mostly grading, office hours, and a few long review sessions before tests. I have never made
a curriculum before. I am hoping for the best! It's a fun topic and I really hope they enjoy it!
